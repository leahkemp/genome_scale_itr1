The *first* iteration of the goal to see how to scale of genomic data could be portrayed/communicated

## Info

Genome size data was downloaded from the NCBI genomes FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/species_genome_size.txt.gz)

*Note. genome_scale_data.csv was manually created and is likely not accurate, particularly for viruses*
